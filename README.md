# Student_Stress

Anyone who has spent more than a minute in a classroom in the past decade can sense the anxiety. This is especially true for college students who are balancing the stresses of tests, projects, activities, jobs, a social life, and maybe even sleep while also navigating changing family relations and keeping an eye on the future. While at times, stress can be a helpful and powerful motivator, there are a number of issues with the levels of stress being seen on campuses today. High levels of stress can negatively effect reasoning and memory, impact sleep, and spark a number of other academic and health issues. It can be hard for a person to grow or thrive in such conditions, and effort should be given to understanding and mitigating this campus crisis. 

What are the stated primariy causes of stress for undergraduate students? Which factors are tied together, and which are the most impactful? Are there factors whose impact is understated but revealed in data? How do we help students minimize toxic and destructive stress without eliminating the motivating kind? To being the search for and creation of solutions, the sources of stress and connections between them must be understood. 

In this short study, I use data from Kaggle.com to investigate sources of undergraduate student stress and some of their affects on student health and outcomes. The data scope is relatively small, looking at 816 students in the first sample and 1110 in the second.

Before beginning full EDA, I first checked for null value and duplicate rows. The first data set had a number of dumplicates which reduced the usable rows to 816 from 843.
